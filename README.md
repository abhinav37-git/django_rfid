This project is an RFID-based attendance system that utilizes NodeMCU (an IoT development board) and Django (a Python-based web framework) as the backend. The system allows for efficient tracking and recording of attendance using RFID technology.

Features

RFID card reader: The NodeMCU board is connected to an RFID card reader, which can read the unique IDs of RFID cards or tags.
Real-time data transfer: The NodeMCU board sends the RFID card information to the Django backend in real-time.
Database management: The Django backend stores the attendance data in a database, allowing for easy retrieval and analysis.
Web interface: The system provides a user-friendly web interface built with Django, where administrators can manage attendance records and generate reports.
Components Required

NodeMCU board: This ESP8266-based development board acts as the hardware interface between the RFID card reader and the Django backend.
RFID card reader: A device capable of reading RFID cards or tags and providing their unique IDs to the NodeMCU board.
RFID cards or tags: Each student or participant will have an RFID card or tag associated with their identity.
Django backend: A server-side application built with Django to handle data storage, retrieval, and management.
Setup Instructions

Hardware setup:
Connect the RFID card reader to the NodeMCU board following the manufacturer's instructions.
Ensure that the NodeMCU board is connected to the internet via Wi-Fi or other means.
Django backend setup:
Install Python on your computer if you don't have it already.
Install Django using pip: pip install django.
Create a new Django project: django-admin startproject attendance_system.
Create a new Django app within the project: cd attendance_system && python manage.py startapp rfid_attendance.
Configure the database settings in the settings.py file.
Create the necessary Django models and database tables for attendance tracking.
Implement the necessary API endpoints for receiving RFID data from the NodeMCU board.
NodeMCU firmware setup:
Install the Arduino IDE and ESP8266 board package.
Configure the Arduino IDE to work with NodeMCU (select the appropriate board and port).
Install the necessary libraries for RFID card reading and Wi-Fi connectivity.
Write the firmware code to read RFID card information and send it to the Django backend.
Deploy and test:
Deploy the Django backend to a web server or host it locally for testing.
Upload the NodeMCU firmware to the board.
Test the system by swiping an RFID card on the reader and checking if the data is correctly received and stored in the Django backend.
Usage

Administrators can access the web interface provided by the Django backend.
The web interface allows administrators to manage attendance records, view reports, and perform other related tasks.
When a participant swipes their RFID card on the reader, the NodeMCU board sends the card information to the Django backend in real-time.
The Django backend records the attendance data in the database, associating it with the corresponding participant.

Here are some possible enhancements you can consider for your RFID-based attendance system:

Add authentication and access control to the web interface for improved security.
Implement real-time notifications or alerts when attendance is recorded.
Integrate with other systems or services, such as email or messaging platforms, to automate communication related to attendance.
Develop a mobile application to provide a more convenient interface for administrators and participants.
Explore data visualization options to generate interactive reports and insights from the attendance data.
